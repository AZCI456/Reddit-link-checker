As a former international student, this post is annoying to me. When I decided to study abroad, I wasn’t naive that I’m moving to a new place where people don’t speak in my native language and will have to communicate heavily in English. I didn’t expect the citizens of the place to be accomodating of what is foreign to me. I respected that I am a visitor in their country, in their home, so it’s my responsibility to adjust and blend my culture but ensure it does not overpower theirs. Obviously if your girlfriend got a 6.5 on her iELTS and can communicate English well, people won’t avoid her. I’ve had people in my class who only spoke another language during group works pissed me the fuck off because I, myself—another international student— is actually making the effort to ensure fairness with locals and other international student where the only common language is English. While YOU, are NOT. I don’t give a shit about your comfort—shouldn’t have chosen to study in an English -speaking country then. You can speak in your language once the group discussion finishes, just like I DO with my same ethnic classmates. And I might add those who got a high iELTS result but wouldn’t speak a line of fucking English piss me off to another dimension. Most people say their greetings at start of the sem and could already weed out who they don’t want to interact with and that’s their choice.


White people are under attack by the elite. White nations are being destroyed by anti natalist ideology like abortions, feminism, birth control and mass immigration! They openly brag that whites will be a minority in a few decades.

Luca reacted instantly, his body slipping off the bar stool and trying to twist away. But Sollozzo had grabbed his other hand at the wrist. Still, Luca was too strong for both of them and would have broken free except that a man stepped out of the shadows behind him and threw a silken cord around his neck. The cord pulled tight, choking off Luca’s breath. His face became purple, the strength in his arms drained away. Tattaglia and Sollazzo held his hands easily now, and they stood there curiously childlike as the man behind Luca pulled the cord around Luca’s neck tighter and tighter. Suddenly the floor was wet and slippery. Luca’s sphincter, no longer under control, opened, the waste of his body spilled out.
