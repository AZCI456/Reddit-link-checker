The Justice Society was given a new mission. An active city destroying collision of a masked vigilante in a black and gold suit and an enormous entity composed of what seemed to be sand was demolishing and tearing through the alleyways of New York City. Atom Smasher and Hawkgirl were enough.

Al and Kendra were inside the Hawk cruiser heading for New York.

“Have you ever been to the city?” asked Al, occupied with suiting up.

”Nah not really, I heard it's really similar to Metropolis tho.” Kendra replied.

”Who do you think these people are? I mean the guys literally made out of sand—how do you think he pees?

“And do you think my mace could hurt him? what if it just… passed through.”

”I'll take care of the sand guy and you get the rope guy. Oh! And I can finally yell why don’t you pick on people your own size!”

“That was literally the corniest thing I've ever heard in my entire life.” Kendra told Al.

"At least I don't literally hawk when I fight?!”

”It emits fear into them, because the next thing they know my mace is up their ass.”

While Kendra was driving, Al projected a live video broadcast of the fight onto the right side of the windshield allowing them both to know what they were getting into.

”How is the guy in black crawling on walls and why are his eyes like that? Is he some kind of spider themed hero?”

”If he is a hero.” Al replied.

But deep inside Al was really more interested in the spider guy than the giant sand man. Was he of the same age? Was he a good guy? Could they get to know each other? I mean Al didn’t even know where he came from.

As they approached the city, they were immediately greeted with the severity of the fight; the guy in black and gold suit seemed to barely hold himself together… because now the sand creature wasn’t alone, there was a figure of pure yellow electricity floating above and it seemed to be siphoning the power of the city into its body.

Al and Kendra looked at each other and prepared themselves.

Al dropped from the ship and immediately enlarged himself; he landed directly on top of the sand man—with an enormous impact scattering the residual sand on the ground into buildings and streets—and dissolved him. Had he won already?

The sand man immediately reformed behind him and grabbed him by the back of his neck and threw him into the black and gold guy.

They both collided mid air but not before Al shrinked to human size, he didn’t want to break this interesting man’s neck did he?

”Oww….” Al groaned as they landed into some roof top.

”Heyyy… I'm Spider Man.” The black and gold suited guy said weakly.

”I'm Atom smasher, but please call me Al.”

Al didn’t know what made him tell this complete stranger his name; he strangely felt the need to immediately connect with him… no. He wanted to know him, not this “Spider Man” crap.

”Oh. hi Al, well I guess if you trust me enough with your “Al” then I'm Peter… Peter Parker. Listen we haven't got much time for chit chat but trust me I would love to talk more”

wait what… me too

”But that sandy guy that just threw you to me, he's called the sand man and that elec-“

Peter and Al’s conversation was cut short when they saw Kendra (after finally finding a parking spot for the Hawk cruiser) charging for the electrified figure and bashing his head with her mace—but immediately after, he re-emerged just below her and redirecting a bolt of electricity through multiple poles of metal that served as conductors therefore multiplying the force of the blast right into her very metal suit.

”Kendra!” Albert yelled as he saw the hawkgirl looking like a fallen angel dropping from a very high altitude, he enlarged himself and caught her just in time.

”I know what to do now” Kendra said groggily but already starting to get up, “You and that black and gold guy get this electrified mother fucker since your body can minimize his bolts because… well of your size and he can hide behind you and soccer punch that bitch”

”Copy that.” Peter said already behind Al.

“Ok lets get these bitches,” Kendra said. “I'm Hawkgirl nice to meet you.”

”I’m Spider Man.”

”She’s Kendra, Peter.”

”Al! What the hell?!”

”Oh then I’m Peter, Kendra it's nice to meet you.”

”Whatever, let's just get through with this.”

Kendra immediately flew towards the sand man and spun in a way that made her look (and probably felt) like a missile directly into him, once she was in him though compressed with sand, she then flew while spinning and swinging her mace in the same way she did earlier but now upwards into the inside of his head. She essentially ripped a hole through him; and now to finish her plan while the sand man was still defigured and in chunks, she flew straight towards the three fire hydrants that encircled this stupid monster. She flew for the first one and hit it with her mace while showing now effort and immediately going for the next two. When she finished she watched the monster dissolve into a massive puddle of gooey wet sand.

“Woah! Thanks Hawkgirl!” Peter exclaimed while shooting the puddle with a gold beam of mystical energy and it immediately vanished straight into Dr. Strange’s lair.

”What the fuck?” Where did it go?

”I'll explain later.” Peter said.

By the time Kendra had dissolved the sand man, Al and Peter were already on the final stage of beating the electrified bastard.

When the yellow figure blasted a beam Al immediately enlarged and shielded the target, absorbing the electricity with his chest and into the rest of him; he used both of his hands to shield the ongoing blasts. With that he felt a web attach to his back and immediately heard and saw Peter swinging from beneath both of his legs in a dramatic arch upward. He swore he saw it in slow mo. Peter then fucking back flip kicked the mother fucker and before his body even hit the ground, Peter again shot him with the gold beam and his limp unconcious body just dissapeared.

They had won.

”Hell yea!” Al yelled while shrinking down.

”Fuck Im tired.” Kendra groaned but then immediately faced Peter. “Explain.”

”Hey so yea um my name’s Peter Parker and I’m from another universe.”

”what…”

”See this is New York but it's so different from where I’m from it’s really really weird.”

”So who were those guys?” Al asked him.

”Actually Im not even sure see in my universe I kinda really fucked up bad and I asked this wizard named Dr. Strange to cast spell to sort of reverse my mistakes but then it ended up going very very very bad, and those guys are the villains of my alternate selves…. and well two of them ended up here and the spell like malfunctioned or something and pulled me with them; I mean that gold beam I used Dr. Strange gave me that and he’s probably so confused right now.”

”Well that’s a story” Kendra yawned.

”So do you have a way of going back? you know to your own universe?” Al worried.

“No clue.” Peter said in an unfortunate tone.

”Well weirdly enough, that Dr. Strange guy you said? We also have a similar guy on our team, Dr. Fate. And if anyone knows any magic to get you through some universes or whatever… It's him.” Al explained.

”Then it’s settled,” Kendra said. “We go back to the hall and you guys figure that shit out while I sleep, let's go home.”

But Albert couldn't shake off this feeling, this pit in his stomach that he could alter so well, somewhere deep inside him… he didn’t want Peter to go.

When they arrived back at the Fortress through the Hawk cruiser, Kendra bolted straight for the entrance and was nowhere to be seen.

”Do you want to tell Dr. Fate already? about your whole situation right now or do you wanna wait til tomorrow? It’s really late and I think he’s sleeping but I can wake him up if you want to.”

”Oh I really don’t want to be a bother and plus I promised you that chit chat session a while ago.”

”Ok so you’ll spend the night?”

”If that’s fine I would love to.”

”Ok let’s go, follow me but I'm kinda hungry though do you mind if we make something to eat.”

Peter nodded.

Once inside, Al held Peter’s arm and led him towards the kitchen. Peter sat on the counter while Al was slicing loaves of bread to make two sandwiches.

”So do you have a girlfriend?” Peter asked.

”No.” Al thought that question was so sexy, and in his defense Peter was looking so sexy right now.

”Well I do but I think she’s cheating on me, with my best friend,”

”Oh shit, that sucks man who would cheat on such a cutie like you?”

Oh fuck was Albert bad at flirting. But thankfully Peter tilted his head and smiled.

What Peter did next both shocked and excited Albert Rothstein.

Peter walked behind Al who was evidently way taller and meatier than he was but still, wrapped both of his hands around Al’s waist and tiptoed to whisper something in his ear.

”Can I sleep in your room?”

“Fuck yea.”

Albert shoved both plates of sandwiches in the fridge and threw everything else in the sink. Then he carried Peter by both of his legs and then grabbed both of his thighs making Peter essentially sit on him while they were both standing. He then walked to his room while carrying the kid, locked the door, and knew he was about to fuck the shit out of Peter Parker.

”Fuck your cute.” breathed Peter while licking Al’s lips and making out with him.

”I think I love you.” Albert laughed while enjoying the taste of Peter’s tongue.

”Al I love you so much.” Peter said while non stop kissing the guy everywhere, his tongue was out of control.

Al just stood in the middle of the room while Peter came down from him still making out viciously.

Albert was still in his Atom smasher suit just without the mask and Peter unsuited earlier in the cruiser so he was just wearing a black shirt and black pants.

Al then lifted Peter and laid him above his desk where his books and awards fell on the floor.

”Shit your smart and hot, that makes me so hard.” Peter was fucking blushing out.

Peter was so chill a while ago who knew he wanted Alberts dick so badly huh?

”Baby I’m gonna fucking eat your ass out ok?” Al was so ready to put this divine anus in his lips.

”Ok Al but kiss me more before you do. I've never tasted anything better than your mouth.” Peter said.

”Fuck Peter your gonna make me cum just by those words come here.”

Peter again made Al carry him and they made out for five more minutes having the time of their lives.

”Al please spit in my mouth, I would drink a cup of your saliva if I could.” Peter was so fucking horny now.

Al then really huffed into the back of his throat and spit a nice clot of white bubblish saliva right into Peter’s mouth. Peter laid back down into the desk really savouring Albert’s sweet saliva. He was now laying on his back and his waist down was dangling from the table.

”Fuck it tastes so good Al.”

Albert then knelt down and pulled Peter’s pants down and his underwear also.

Peter’s dick was now exposed; it was a fair size but Al had his eyes elsewhere.

With no warning whatsoever Al lifted both of Peter’s legs and began making out with his hole.

”UGHHHH AL FUCK Ive never felt so good in my entire fucking life baby! I love you, I love you so much! UGHH!” Peter exclaimed.

Al loved the taste of Peter’s anus and was licking the shit out of it. Not a fucking word could describe how turned on and rock hard he was right now.

”Im in heaven; Im in fucking heaven.” Peter realized.

Al then, lifted Peter up now just wearing a black shirt and walked him towards the bed.

”Is it finally my turn Al? I would do anything to suck your cock right now. A while ago when I swung below it I wanted to taste your huge balls so much and it took everything in me not to.

“I love you so fucking much right now Peter Parker” Al confessed.

Al then laid on his bed with his waist down dangling from the bed and Peter was already looking at the imprint of his cock beneath that ever so tight suit and was licking his lips.

”Fuck im so exited.” He knelt down and pulled down Albert’s pants and was fucking flabergasted with how motherfucking big his cock was.

”Are you fucking using your powers right now?” Peter asked.

Al shook his head.

Peter without a thought, licked the top of Al’s uncut dick and was already swirling his tongue in enjoyment.

Albert was alreaady fucking shaking with pleasure “Fuck Peter your gonna make me cum so early, that tounge is godly.” Al said.

Peter was having the time of his life feasting on Al’s colossal cock and was trying so hard to swallow every millimeter of it. God did it taste good. But Peter already missed Al’s mouth so he took a break and crawled up to his face and made out with him more.

“Al stick out your tounge” Al obeyed.

Albert did not fucking expect what Peter did next.

Peter then licked Al’s exposed tongue non stop from every direction. Left to right, right to left, up and down.

”Al I love you.”

“I love you too Peter.”

Peter went back down and licked the hell out of Al’s balls every part, his balls, his dick, his pubes. Everything.

”UUGGHHHHHHH PETEERR FUCK THAT FEELS GOOD IM GONNA CUM IM GONNA CUM IM GONNA CUM!”

Peter then suprisingle very strong, flipped Al on his back and feasted on the hole of his ass even more. He adored the taste of it every single thing he could do to pleasure Al he did. He shoved his tongue into Al’s hole and Al groaned so much.

Peter flipped him again and kissed his mouth even more. He was obsessed with it.

”I want it in me Al, can I?”

”I'm begging you Peter.”

Al then lifted Peter again but this time he sat on his chair and cow girled Peter while sitting.

Al shoved it in. Peter moaned. They were kissing while they were fucking.

Peter was bouncing on Al like a mad man. He loved it. He was moaning “Albert” like his life depended on it; and Albert was hanging on for dear life, he was doing everything he can to stop himself from cumming.

”ALBERT ALBERT DADDY I LOVE YOU FUCK ME!”

”Think you can take more baby?”

”Anything to make you feel better daddy.”

Albert enlarged his dick just bit by bit until Peter moaned to stop.

”FUCKK ALBERT YOU SATISFY ME IN EVERY WAY I LOVE YOUR COCK, I LOVE YOUR MOUTH, I LOVE YOUR TONGUE, I LOVE YOU. I would stay in this universe if it meant getting to taste your mouth everyday!”

That did it.

The Atom Smasher came so hard Peter went limp. But not wanting to waste it all Peter climbed off of Albert and in the middle of him cumming and groaning, Peter shoved Albert's cock some more in his mouth and drank his cum like it was the nectar of the gods. He then shortly after came himself onto the legs of the chair.

Cum was still dripping on Al’s cock and thighs and Peter was still trying to lick it all.

They made out for 30 more minutes.

“Are you gonna stay? Peter.”

”For you Al.”
